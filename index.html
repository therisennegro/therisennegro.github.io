                    <p>In the decades when the oppression of Black people was prominent, the Civil Rights movement was gaining traction with non-confrontational actions of Martin Luther King, Jr. and many others. However, there were those who didnâ€™t believe in non-violent protests, and preferred direct action, even if it meant getting physical with their oppressors. This book presents some of those important people who contrasted the non-violent movement against oppression, and helped fuel the legend and meaning of <strong>Black Power.</strong></p>
